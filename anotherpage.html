    <p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(95, 92, 94);">&#8226; Posted on 4 August 2024 by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Syntergica</span></p>

        <div class="content">

<p>It has to be quite clear at this point that the world we experience is an entity that cannot be dissociated from our own minds. We cannot be absolutely sure about anything but our own conscious experience and its contents.
Thus, the world is as vast as it appears at any given moment of human conscious experience.</p>
<p>As was argued before, the simulator we inhabit depends on sensory information and it only needs to update now and then to maintain the illusion that we're living in a solid and stable reality. 
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>This simulation evolves coherently as it integrates new sensory information.
    </p></blockquote>

    <p>We can only know the universe through a miniature model of itself which is nothing but our own minds, and if that wasn't enough, the world we tend to assume as the substantial and authentic external reality is also an extension of the human consciousness that exists for evolutionary reasons, just as Carl Sagan said once: <span style="color: gray; font-style: italic;">"We are a medium through which the universe can know itself"</span>.
    </p>
    <p>If someone asked me for an intuitive way of putting this I'd say that phenomenology is actually how our world simulation looks from the very inside.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Whenever we aim to describe the phenomenology of human experience what we're actually doing is to describe the insides of our world simulations.
    </p></blockquote>
    <p>Perception has two priorities, the most important is to provide analogical representations of the environment based on sensory input, and the second one relies on predictions, which constitute a subtle but not less significant part of our world simulation.</p>
    <p>As was previously argued, an analogical representation based solely on sensory input isn't enough to meet all the needs that perception seeks to fulfill. Another but not less important function of the brain is to anticipate the tendencies of the environment that it represents. This counteracts the partial blindness of world simulations by allowing them to include an internal record of things that are no longer perceivable.
    </p>
    <p>Anything that resides beyond the grasp of the senses is technically nonexistent for a representation that depends entirely on sense data. Then, anything beyond the sense's grasp is predicted instead of represented.
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>Everything that remains hidden from the senses is expressed within our world simulation as a void that could be filled instead with nothing but our expectations, beliefs, and assumptions concerning the world.
    </p></blockquote>
    <div class="center">
        <a class="link-1" style="display: inline; cursor: pointer; color: blue" href="http://slehar.com/wwwRel/webstuff/book/fig6.4.html"><img style="max-width: 750px; width: 100%"
    src="imagenes para el sitio/amodal.png"></a>
    </div>
    <blockquote><p>As portrayed in this picture, our world simulation fills the gaps with what it seems adequate to expect from the environment, based on previously observed tendencies or patterns. </p></blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">This would mean that we are actively rendering a "hypothetical universe" that is expected to reside beyond the walls of the precise moment of sensory experience we are immersed in, upon nothing but expectations and predictions.
    Among the things we are actively sculpting within our heads, few of the most significants would be:
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>- The history of Humankind (the past in general)<br>
        - Modern cultures and societies <br>
        - The individual minds of other human beings <br>
        - The future <br>
        - Any event that's heard of instead of directly known through lived experience
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"So...Pretty much you are not mad at anyone. You're only mad with the private predictions you've built of other people, you know, all of those internal perceptual copies of other human beings that you include within the sophisticated ecosystem of your world simulation". 
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>"Everyone is an extension of your private world simulation since, you know, indirect theory of perception, blah, blah..." </p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, the reader may consider the world of its phenomenal experience as nothing but its own brain's activity masquerading itself as the authentic and extracranial external world. Acknowledging that in reality, we can only exist within the limits of the brain, just as fishes cannot live outside of the water.

</p>
<blockquote><p>Strangely, people who are not familiarized with this subject tend to be more convinced of this premise when the topic in question is dreams. It's rather easy to think that everything we experience in dreams is nothing but our internal brain activity masquerading itself as a somewhat solid and stable world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The brain is not inside of you, as you believed, but you're inside the brain, and everything you're experiencing is nothing but its internal activity.
    And everyone else is an extension of your consciousness. Replicas furnished with your internal model of them as having a world simulation of their own.
</p>
<blockquote><p>As I have previously emphasized, everything that makes up the contents of our consciousnesses exists within the confines of enclosed, finite, and private systems called world simulations.</p> <p>In essence, you're the world of experience. For example, let's imagine you make someone feel bad or upset by throwing a hurtful comment, that perhaps you weren't even aware was offensive, but now you feel a little bit of guilt, however, you keep implicitly assuming that you are a completely free and emotionally detached individual, but as the hours go by, you realize that the empathetic function of your mind has started to betray those beliefs. Even though you aren't representing that person anymore via sensory input, you still incorporate an internal perceptual copy of themself that also includes an internal model of their hypothetical mind wandering around in your world simulation, rendering entire mental scenes of themself feeling awful for what you said. That's a poison that starts contaminating the walls of your experience, because tadaah!, nothing is outside of your mind as you believed it was. You're trapped inside your subjective-conscious experience, which is quite everything you can access, including the things you think don't concern you. Obviously, there are a ton things that we can't change, but which consume a significant part of our attention and energy. In this example, the mere act of assuming or inferring another's person mindset has already an effect on the structure of our private world simulation. If we are not enough self-reflecting, introspective, and emotionally intelligent persons, we may end up sharing the four walls of our private conscious experience with parasitic entities.  
</p></blockquote>
<p style="color:gray; font-style: italic;">"The problems of the world are also your problems because you are always rendering them in your mind."
</p>
<p>I enjoy thinking of world simulations as private, bounded, and isolated universes where, well...the only inhabitant is you. And the observer and what's being observed are indeed different local components of the same unified entity that is our world simulation. There's no dramatic distinction between the experiencer and the world of experience.

<blockquote><p>In my "private-phenomenal bubble" I appear located right at the center of the world of my experience, as if I were the protagonist of my own movie, while you appear as the analogous of a secondary character to which I don't have a direct nor explicit access to their "hypothetical internal movie" of which (I infer) you exist as the main character within it, and I as the secondary instead. The bubble where I stand also includes different properties and phenomenal tokens that seem only exclusive to me, impossible to share with others. This reinforces the indirect realism arguement, implying that each of our brains is representing and rendering slighly different inputs, giving the illusion of individuality within the "same world". </p></blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;">Now I would like to bring up an interesting state of consciousness. Falling in love. Precisely, the experience of having a crush. Let's examine a moment of experience whereby you are lucky enough as to go on a date with your crush, and have the opportunity to know her better while enjoying the day by strolling through the park.</p>
<p>If you analyze and dissect the experience of perceiving her, besides the phenomenal surface of her appearance, you'd realize that a significant part of her is made of nothing but your own frustrations and expectations.</p>

<blockquote><p>Behind her perceptual-phenomenal avatar, is "her mind", which is also your brain activity masquerading itself as so, as it resides within the terrain of your private world simulation, while her authentic world simulation resides beyond the walls of your private-subjective experience/world simulation, within her genuine brain, housed by her real-physical skull, where she also includes a perceptual-phenomenal replica of yourself, mostly composed and parameterized by her own standards and narratives, as her brain tries to simulate your brain.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same way..."Other's minds" is also our brain's activity masquerading itself as predictive perceptual models.
</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal note:</span> I must not mistake the minds of others with my own mental processes.</p></blockquote>
<br>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Neurophenomenology and its implications</h3>
<p>It is easy to assimilate these ideas if we see them through the lens of neurophenomenology.
    This branch of study suggests that the contents of our conscious experience correlate with the brain's activity.</p>
<p>This suggests that the world of our conscious experience corresponds with a cluster of brain activity, revealing its nature as a perceptual replica modulated by this sophisticated machine. As presumably inferred, all the properties seen in the world of our experience have to be correlated with certain patterns of cortical activation.</p>
<p>Although there's a huge debate about the resemblance between phenomenology and the brain's structure, there's enough evidence to indicate there's a clear correlation.
    The concept of "world simulations" presents neurophenomenology in a somewhat fancy and accurate way. 
    </p>
<p>The concept of world simulation provides a bridge between the contents of conscious experience and the brain. As it has been discussed on multiple occasions, human phenomenology exhibits certain properties and behaviors that suggest a strong correlation with the brain's functioning. This also reinforces the indirect realism arguement.</p>
<blockquote><p>You'd realize that the neuron's activity is the medium or the substance that sustains the universe of our conscious experience, the contents of human phenomenology.</p></blockquote>
<p>The structure and properties of a moment of conscious human experience are correlated with the intracranial brain's activity. Therefore, and as suggested previously, it wouldn't be odd to argue that the world of our conscious experience is nothing but our brain activity masquerading itself as the authentic external environment since its function is of a model or representation &#8212;indirect realism&#8212;.</p>
<p>When the brain's activity suffers an alteration, the contents of our consciousness get directly affected too.</p>
<blockquote><p>An overexcitement in the visual cortex, for example, appears in the world of our experience as an evident distortion. The distortion presents itself as a completely dynamic scene of shapes and figures covering the surfaces of the structures of our conscious experience, while the modern scientific method can only register it as a spike of activation in such cortical area.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This video presents a representation of the phenomenological description above, commonly reported under the influence of psychedelics. Psychedelic drugs tend to stimulate multiple areas of the brain's cortex at once, which appear in the phenomenal world as a wide range of distortions, and emergence of exotic phenomenal properties. Sounds, textures, colors, and shapes, become evidently perturbed by the overexcitement of neurons.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When we look at the neurons firing and the cortical areas activating, we're actually registering and contemplating how the brain encodes the information that corresponds with our conscious experience but not how it renders it.
</p> <p>There's to be a fancy way in which brain operations account for the volumetric and sophisticated design of human phenomenology.</p></blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;">Human consciousness is a private and isolated "bubble" that's modulated by the brain. This bubble instantiates our world simulation.</p>
<blockquote><p>We only have access to a private virtual model of the inescrutable extracranial environment, which is our conscious experience, sustained by our nervous system.

</p>
<p>The world around us, and our phenomenal selves are made of brain activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we shut down the brain, the world of our experience fades out. The brain is somehow sustaining our entire existence as we all know it.
    It's essential to understand where we're standing.</p> <blockquote><p>The contents of our conscious experience correspond with a model sustained by the brain. We are the model.
    </p></blockquote>
<p>Perception works in function of isolated models that are covered with several layers of biological tissue that can keep the internal system updated with information that comes from the external, extracranial environment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perception could be defined as the generation and optimization of analogical representations in an isolated space, where these can be used to shape external responses and behavior. The brain is in essence, a computer specialized in rendering whole models complemented with predictions about the organism's conditions, along with preparing and orchestrating outputs or responses throught its biological extensions &#8212;the physical body&#8212;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that you are having a complete human conscious experience right now, which includes the world, the textures, the sounds, the sensations, the colors, the shapes, the concepts and mental images you render in your mind, even the whole universe, the stars, the internal layers of this planet, the history of humankind, all of these things, only indicate that you are inhabiting a functional brain.</p>
<blockquote><p>A world simulation includes multiple layers or levels. Boundaries within boundaries, so to speak. 
    The limit of our vision is the most the eyes can reach, like the farthest things in our visual field or the most intricate perceivable detail that we could be aware of on its contents.
    Beyond the walls of visual and auditory experience, we'd find the phenomenal architecture of predictive and a-modal percepts masquerading themselves as the world, the universe, and reality. Beyond those it resides the internal surface of our world simulation; the horizon of our phenomenology.
    </p></blockquote>
<br>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">The Phenomenological Paradigm</h3>
<p>If we want to take conscious experiences seriously, we should recur to the phenomenology, which is a branch of study specialized to the description of conscious experience's structures and properties. <p>Phenomenology focuses on the lived experiences of human beings, as they intrinsically appear from the first-person and subjective perspective. In other words, phenomenology starts from the most evident, basic, and primary thing, which is conscious subjective human experience, the only thing that we can be absolutely sure exists. </p>
<div class="center">
    <a class="link-1" style="display: inline; cursor: pointer; color: blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 300px; width: 100%"
src="imagenes para el sitio/phenomenologysphere.jpg"></a>
</div>
<blockquote><p>Phenomenology seeks to dissect conscious experiences and unveil their very nature.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, we have neurophenomenology, which is the coalition of two branches of study (neuroscience and phenomenology). This area seeks to unveil the correlation between consciousness and brain activity. It focuses on the mechanisms in the brain responsible for the sophisticated architecture and qualities of human conscious experiences, looking for hints of how brains might make the mind, and how they render and maintain conscious experiences.
</p>
<p>I think phenomenology can be considered a reference point for all branches of study since the root of all knowledge is human-conscious experience. </p> <blockquote><p>Human experience is the base of any primary understanding.</p></blockquote>
<p>We, humans, tend to dissociate ourselves from the world we perceive, leading to currents of thought such as objectivism, which for phenomenology is nothing but an idealization, an image rendered within our minds.
</p>
<blockquote><p>The objective world is inferred from the comfy seat of the phenomenal subjective human experience.
    In other words, the external world is supposed rather than perceived directly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>By mere introspection, we can reach the same conclusion. What's the thing we all share in common, and can be absolutely sure it exists? 
    Phenomenal Experience must be it.
    Phenomenal experience is considered to be the most fundamental pillar of the human condition, and it is in essence the root of all knowledge and understanding. </p>
    <p>After all, as if it were an indispensable requisite, we have to be fully immersed in the human experience to be able to fire the spark of intellectual pursuit. In other words, the first step is to be alive as a human being.
    It's only within the territory of the phenomenal and subjective human experience that abstraction and conceptualization can occur. The cognitive abilities we enjoy and take for granted can only be found in the sophisticated console of the human mind, which is where all of us stand. 
    </p>
    <blockquote><p>
        Subjective-phenomenal experience is the most intimate way in which the universe presents itself.
        </p></blockquote>
    <p>I'd argue that consciousness is what gives value and meaning. If we think about it, everything revolves around the fact that we're conscious beings.
        Everything that science does is meaningful for it focuses on the effects it has on the phenomenal human experience (the lifeworld).
        </p>
<br>
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Phenomenology: Experience</h3>
        <blockquote><p>"I'm walking in the park while eating a cone of Ice cream. It's a partly cloudy day. I can feel the warmth of the sun over my back and shoulders, hearing the chirps of birds in the distance, and over my head. I can also hear the noise of my steps as I walk on gravel. Enjoying the pleasant flavor of strawberry in my mouth, while also fixing my attention on a small itch right below my ankle. A sudden and cold blow of air hit my face, but nothing can bother me as much as the fact I'm taking a biology exam tomorrow, which I can't help but to feel anxious."
        </p></blockquote>
        <p>That's an example of an experience. If we look at an experience, what we would see is the world, the objects around us, the sensations, the feelings, the emotions, the thoughts, and the ideas we have about the world. Experience embodies all of these things. Experiences are what make up our lives, the lifeworld, the human condition.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, "consciousness" is a sophisticated term to refer to the very fact we're having experiences, the fact that there's a qualitative, and intrinsic event of which we are aware, and how things appear to us in direct experience, that the subcomponents of my experience are happening at once within the same moment of experience.
            The term "conscious experience" emphasizes the connotation of experience as a matter of study in philosophy.

            <blockquote><p>Therefore, conscious experiences would be defined as the intrinsic and qualitative way in which the things and events of human life present themselves.</p></blockquote>
            <p>The overall conscious-human experience is switched by the term "world simulation", and phenomenology is simply the method that's used to map and describe its architecture. As mentioned before, world simulationism comes primarily as a fashionable concept to illustrate neuro-phenomenology. </p> <blockquote><p>Neuroscience is the study of the brain, and phenomenology is the study of conscious experience.</p></blockquote> <p>Neurophenomenology is the union between these two branches of study. 
                The brain and consciousness are considered to be correlated with each other. The theory suggests that minds are what brains do. The conscious human experience and brain activity are the same thing, both are isomorphic.
                </p>
            <p>This leads to indirect realism, which suggests that our experience of the world is indirect rather than direct for multiple complicated reasons. That phenomenal human experience, which embodies the world we see, hear, touch, and feel, corresponds with a model that the brain is instantiating. In other words, the world we experience is the brain activity masquerading itself as the authentic external world because it is a representation. This framework is known as representalism or indirect realism, as opposed to direct or naive realism. The model is what we see, and the authentic world is inscrutable and inaccessible. The properties and features of conscious experiences correlate with the brain's activity configurations or modes of operation.</p>
            <blockquote><p>The neurons are the architects and computer engineers of experience. 
                Neurons sculpt the sophisticated architecture of the phenomenal-subjective-human experience.
                </p></blockquote>
                <p>Direct realism is phenomenologically evident in the world of our conscious experience, but it's because phenomenology can only describe the insides of world simulations since it is its terrain of study. World simulations are where conscious human subjective experience occurs.
